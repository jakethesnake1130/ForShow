# RoadTrip
My very first Java project!
Here is a simple program that takes inputs and calculates a few basic statistics regarding the user's road trip plans.
Demonstrated are basic skills including accepting/storing user inputs, working with print statements and different primitive 
variables, and using Java math.
Also getting a feel for notations and code organization.
